# Hi, I'm Daniel üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm a junior Python developer building real-world, terminal-based and script-powered applications with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and utility. I love creating tools that automate tedious tasks, clean up data, and generate useful outputs like HTML, CSV, and PDFs.

So far, I‚Äôve built:

- A **file organizer** that sorts files by extension
- A **web scraper** that pulls quote data into a CSV
- An **inventory tracker** with add/edit/delete functionality and persistent storage
- A **portfolio site generator** (you're looking at it!) that converts Markdown and JSON into a clean, styled HTML website

I'm currently diving deeper into:
- Jinja2 templating
- Project packaging
- Client-focused development workflows
