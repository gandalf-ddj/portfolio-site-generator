# Hey, Iâ€™m Daniel Jarvis ðŸš€

I'm a Python developer with a passion for building powerful, real-world tools that make workflows faster, data cleaner, and projects more organized. I specialize in crafting practical terminal apps, automation scripts, and custom site generators from scratch â€” all with clean design, sharp logic, and zero fluff.

In just a few months, Iâ€™ve:
- Built and deployed a **multi-page portfolio site generator** (youâ€™re looking at it!)
- Created a **weather app CLI** that fetches real-time forecasts
- Engineered a **web scraper** that exports structured data to CSV
- Developed tools that **sort files**, **track expenses**, and **manage inventory** â€” all via terminal

Every project you see here was built to solve a problem. And every line of code I write is focused on simplicity, clarity, and long-term usefulness.

ðŸ§° I build it. I polish it. I ship it.  
ðŸ’¡ Letâ€™s build something that works.
